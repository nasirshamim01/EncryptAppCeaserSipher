This is an application that takes a message (String) and does a form of Caesar Cipher Encryption on it to change the message based on a given key. It can also decrypt messages made using this application, so long as the same encryption key is also given.

I created this app as an introduction for myself to Android app development.

For a demonstration and explanation, watch the video below

# Future Work

As with all programs, this one is not perfect right out of the box. Some potential improvements for me to make in the future include:
* Restraining the key input to the requested range
* Making it so the message input doesn't capitalize every word
* Making the keyboard drop when you hit the encrypt or decrypt buttons
* Letting you select and copy the encrypted (or decrypted) message
